# 🕒 Real-Time Clock Using LPC1768 (Embedded C)

This project demonstrates a Real-Time Clock (RTC) implemented using the LPC1768 microcontroller and UART for serial display.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Microcontroller**: LPC1768 (ARM Cortex-M3)
- **Programming Language**: Embedded C
- **Compiler/IDE**: Keil µVision 4
- **Communication**: UART (Serial Terminal)

---

## 📌 Features

- Initializes RTC with preset time and date
- Displays live time via UART serial communication
- Time updates every second using internal interrupts
- Useful in time-stamping, alarms, medical devices, etc.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `rtc_clock.c` → Main program code  
- UART and RTC initialization and time display
